# Hyperbolic Cuts

Hyperbolic Cuts refer to cutting surfaces created using Hyperboloids. They are a form of non-planar cut that can be used to give puzzles unique face patterns or to hide certain piece types.

## Construction
Typical construction of a hyperbolic cut puzzle involves the following steps:

- Creating a base cutting surface for target puzzle
- Drawing desired cut shape on a face adjacent to cutting surface
- Revolving cut shape around same axis of rotation as base cutting surface (This creates a Hyperboloid)
- Splitting the hyperboloid and incorporating its shape into the cutting surface
- Revolving, Patterning, and Splitting the puzzle as normal, with newly designed hyperbolic cutting surface

Hyperbolic cuts can lead to strange geometry that may be difficult to fillet during the finishing steps.

??? warning "WORK IN PROGRESS"

    Contibuting to this wiki should be as accessible as possible. I have not had a chance to write a proper guide and test everything. For now, this page requires a bit of know-how and only lists the bare minimum info to get started.

In order to contribute to this wiki, you will need to have Python and Git installed. 

- Use Git to clone the [Puzzle Makers Wiki Repo](https://github.com/PuzzleMakers/PuzzleMakers.github.io)
- Use your choice of python package manager (ex, pip) to install the dependencies found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/PuzzleMakers/PuzzleMakers.github.io/blob/main/requirements.txt)
- Use `mkdocs serve` to host the page locally and see your changes immediately
- When you're done making changes, put in a pull request!
